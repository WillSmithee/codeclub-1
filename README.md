# $\textcolor{BurntOrange}{\textsf{Assignment  1}}$ - Respond to POST requests
 - After getting Wrangler and Github set up; weâ€™ve seen how to access the **URL** property of an incoming request and do **conditional** logic based on it.
 - In https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/ you can see that there are many other properties of the request which you can access.
 - Using the examples shown here, and the Request documentation, update your Hello Worker template so that is gives a different response for requests with a **POST method**.
   - Bonus points if you make it response in a JSON format, as is often useful for POST requests
 - Place your completed assignment in your Github repository
