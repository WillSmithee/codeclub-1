# $\textcolor{BurntOrange}{\textsf{Assignment  1}}$ - Random Responses
 - Today, your “Hello Worker” project returns the same response every time. Let’s use an API and a Lookup Table to make things more interesting, and a return 1 of 4 Random Responses  to each GET request.
 - You can see a good example in MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random of the basic idea here - using Math.Random and Math.Floor to get a random integer between 1 and max. You can simply use 4 for your max value, and otherwise follow this example exactly. 
 - We also have a quick example of a lookup table https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/country-code-redirect/ in our own documentation.
 - Using these concepts, update your Hello Worker script to return this random response. You’ll want to copy your project in Github, so that your week 1 assignment is still available for reference. You can use the “import project” feature on the UI, or follow these command line instructions https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository
